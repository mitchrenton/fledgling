Fledgling is a starter Wordpress theme.
=======================================

About Fledgling
===============

This theme has been the personal project of Mitchell Renton. It's build for frontend developers that love WordPress and don't want to waste time writing loops, functions, templates etc.

Fledgling is for you
====================

This theme is 100% open source and developer friendly and is under the GNU Public License.

Fledgling uses microdata
========================

The theme is optimised with Schema.org microdata that help search engines recognise your sites content, improving the display of search results.

Fledgling isnâ€™t finished
========================

There are lots more features I'd like to include and these will come. The first version was about stripping back unneeded, bloated markup.


Using Fledgling
===============

This theme is super straight forward, build your HTML/CSS around the WordPress bones!


WordPress Compatibility
=======================

Fledgling was built and tested on WordPress 3.5.1. Any future development of the theme will be focused on supporting the most current version of WordPress.
