Fledgling v2 takes some of the leg work when architecting your next web project
==========================================================================

About Fledgling
===============

Fledgling has been built to take the hassle out of creating the asset architecture on your next project. Not 1 line of CSS or JS is written. Fledgling uses the ITCSS arcitecure from Harry Roberts @csswizardry. The JS architecure is a very basic, app and plugins folder structure.

Under the hood
====================

Fledgling uses the Grunt task runner with the following tasks:

- Clean
- Concat
- JShint
- PostCSS
- SASS
- Uglify
- Versioning
- Watch

Fledgling is for you
